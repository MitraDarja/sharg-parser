# Code of Conduct {#about_code_of_conduct}

The Sharg-parser adheres to the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/). As the Sharg-parser was

applies to the Sharg-parser as well. Please see 
[SeqAn's Code of Conduct](http://docs.seqan.de/seqan/3-master-user/about_code_of_conduct.html) for more
